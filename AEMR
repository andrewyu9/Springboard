1. write a SQL statement that calculates the average duration in days for each valid outage type that compares the average durations 
for Start Time in 2016 and 2017. Order by Reason and Year.

select Status, Reason,
  count(status) as Total_Number_Outage_Events,
  round(avg((TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, Start_Time, End_time)/60)/24),2) as Average_Outage_Duration_Time_Days,
  Year(Start_Time) as Year  
from AEMR
where YEAR(Start_Time) in (2016,2017)
and Status = 'Approved'
group by Reason, Status, Year
order by Reason, Year

2. Write a SQL statement showing the total number of all valid outage types (Forced, Consequential, Scheduled, Opportunistic) that occurred for both 2016 and 
2017 per month (i.e. 1 â€“ 12). Order the year from 2016 to 2017. Order by Month and Year.

select Status,
  count(status) as Total_Number_Outage_Events,
  Month(Start_Time) as Month,
  Year(Start_Time) as Year 
from AEMR
where YEAR(Start_Time) in (2016,2017)
and Status = 'Approved'
group by Status, Month, Year
order by Month, Year

3. Write a SQL statement showing the average duration of all valid (i.e. status = approved) outage types (Forced, Consequential, Scheduled, Opportunistic) for all 
participant codes from 2016 to 2017. Order the average duration in descending order.

select 
   Participant_Code,
   Status,
   Year(Start_Time) as Year,
   round(avg((TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, Start_Time, End_time)/60)/24),2) as Average_Outage_Duration_Time_Days
from AEMR
where YEAR(Start_Time) in (2016,2017)
and Status = 'Approved'
group by Participant_Code, Status, Year
order by  Average_Outage_Duration_Time_Days desc
